Approach
Greedy algorithm
1.An arrow shoots through multiple intervals, all of which are coincident. We try to stack the overlapping intervals together and give a jump.
2.To facilitate identifying coincidence in a single traversal, we sort in ascending order on the right

Complexity
Time complexity:O(NlogN)

Space complexity:O(1)
