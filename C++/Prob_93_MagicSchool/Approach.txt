Solution Approach
- Think about what condition must hold such that B becomes a correct magic number.
- Can something be done with the difference of max with every value?
- Simply take the gcd of difference of all values with the maximum and if B   can divide the gcd then it's a correct answer.


Time complexity: O(N * log(max(A)))
Space complexity: O(N)
