Solution Approach
- The Cost(K) function just finds the sum of the weight of all nodes in the   connected component of K.
- So we can consider every connected component as one node.
- Also we can observe that our answer will be sum of the weight of all the   nodes multiplied by some coefficient.
- So we want this coefficient to be lower for higher weights.
- Therefore choosing the smallest two weighted connected components will give   the optimal answer at every step.
