Simple Easy to understand C++ solution

here i-j will allways be negative as j>=i so
|i-j| =-(i-j)=j-i.

and then we consider two cases

Case 1
arr[i]-arr[j] is positive
curr1 stores the maximum value of -arr[j]+j.


Case 2
arr[i]-arr[j] is negative
arr[j]-arr[i] is positive
curr2 stores the maximum value of arr[j]+j.
And then calsulate the answer accordingly.
