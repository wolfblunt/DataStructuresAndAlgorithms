Question BreakDown - Finding the maximum length having Apples wherein Orange can be converted to Apple atmost m times.

Intuition - Let's say I am taking Apples and in between Oranges come , so If I can convert Orange to Apple , this can be added in maximising apple Sequence.

Like

AAAOAAOA , m=1

first 3 can be taken and since m=1 so one O can also be taken , next two AA can also be taken

AAAOAAOA

But next O can't be taken since m=1 is allowed and I have already converted O to A once.

So, next time

AAAOAAOA can be taken only.

So,basically anytime while maximising sequence, extra O comes , so slide string from ahead until this extra O is not removed.
