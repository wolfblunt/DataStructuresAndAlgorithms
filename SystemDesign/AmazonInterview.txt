So few interview experiences provide direct leetcode problems link. So what I did is, I created a list in leetcode and added them to it, which will be very easy for us to practice. I suggest you to do the same thing. If it is not a leetcode problem or a open question statement track it somewhere, I do it in google docs.
This is my list which has 27 problems https://leetcode.com/problem-list/23kp61xm/ and below are open questions which I found

Matrix Clockwise Rotation – Bar Raiser style

Path Sum I: Given a binary tree and target value, check if there's a path from root to leaf whose node sum equals target

Amazon Locker Problem:

Function to return locker to open when package is received
