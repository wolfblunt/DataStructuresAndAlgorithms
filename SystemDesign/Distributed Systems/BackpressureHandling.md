## Backpressure handling

Backpressure handling is a mechanism in systems processing data streams to manage situations where the rate of incoming data exceeds the system's ability to process it. It prevents overload by controlling the flow of data, ensuring the system doesn't crash or lose data when overwhelmed.

### Key Concepts:
- **Backpressure**: Occurs when a system (e.g., a server, queue, or application) receives data faster than it can process, causing a bottleneck.
- **Goal**: Maintain system stability by regulating data flow, avoiding memory exhaustion or performance degradation.
- **Common Scenarios**: Streaming applications, message queues, network protocols, or APIs handling high request volumes.

### How Backpressure Handling Works:
1. **Buffering**: Temporarily store excess data in a queue or buffer until the system can process it. However, unbounded buffering can lead to memory issues.
2. **Flow Control**: Signal the data producer to slow down or pause sending data until the consumer is ready. Examples:
   - TCP uses sliding windows to control data transmission rates.
   - Reactive programming frameworks (e.g., RxJava, Project Reactor) use signals like "request(n)" to pull a specific number of items from the producer.
3. **Dropping Data**: In extreme cases, discard non-critical data to prevent system failure (e.g., dropping packets in UDP-based systems).
4. **Scaling**: Dynamically allocate more resources (e.g., additional workers or nodes) to handle the load, though this isn't always immediate or feasible.
5. **Circuit Breaking**: Temporarily halt processing or reject new data to protect the system, often used in distributed systems.

### Examples:
- **Reactive Streams**: Libraries like Akka Streams or Project Reactor implement backpressure by allowing consumers to signal how much data they can handle, preventing overwhelm.
- **Message Queues**: Systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ use queues to buffer messages, with consumers pulling data at their own pace.
- **APIs**: Rate-limiting or throttling (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests) is a form of backpressure to prevent server overload.

### Why It Matters:
- **Stability**: Prevents crashes due to resource exhaustion (e.g., memory or CPU).
- **Scalability**: Enables systems to handle variable loads gracefully.
- **Reliability**: Ensures no data is lost (or loss is controlled) in high-throughput scenarios.
