'''
The line `cls._instance = super(MusicPlayer, cls).__new__(cls)` creates a new instance of MusicPlayer 
by calling the parent classâ€™s `_new__` method and stores it in `cls._instance` to enforce the Singleton pattern, 
ensuring only one instance is ever created.
'''

'''
The __new__ method, which is a static method in Python responsible for creating a new instance of a class.
It's called before __init__ and controls the actual object creation.

def test_music_player():
    # Create two "instances" of MusicPlayer
    player1 = MusicPlayer()

    # Check if they are the same instance
    print(player1 is player2)  # Output: True

    # Use the player
    print(player1.play_song("Song A"))  # Output: Playing Song A
    print(player2.play_song("Song B"))  # Output: Playing Song B (overrides Song A)
    print(player1.current_song)         # Output: Song B (shared state)
