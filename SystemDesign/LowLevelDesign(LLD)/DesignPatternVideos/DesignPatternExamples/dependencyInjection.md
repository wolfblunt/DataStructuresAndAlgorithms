**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to achieve **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, where objects do not create their dependencies but receive them from an external source. This promotes loose coupling between components, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

### Key Concepts
1. **Dependency**: Any object that another object depends on.
2. **Injection**: Providing dependencies to an object instead of creating them within the object.

### Example Scenario: Sending Notifications

Imagine a notification system that sends messages via different mediums (e.g., email, SMS, or push notifications).

#### Without Dependency Injection
The `Notifier` class directly instantiates the dependency (e.g., `EmailService`).

```python
class EmailService:
    def send(self, message):
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")


class Notifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.service = EmailService()  # Tight coupling

    def notify(self, message):
        self.service.send(message)


notifier = Notifier()
notifier.notify("Hello, Dependency Injection!")
```

- **Issue**: 
  - `Notifier` is tightly coupled to `EmailService`.
  - Adding or changing the notification medium requires modifying the `Notifier` class, violating the **Open/Closed Principle**.

#### With Dependency Injection
We inject the dependency into the `Notifier` class via its constructor, making it independent of the specific notification medium.

```python
class EmailService:
    def send(self, message):
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")


class SMSService:
    def send(self, message):
        print(f"Sending SMS: {message}")


class Notifier:
    def __init__(self, service):
        self.service = service  # Dependency injected

    def notify(self, message):
        self.service.send(message)


# Using EmailService
email_service = EmailService()
notifier = Notifier(email_service)
notifier.notify("Hello via Email!")

# Using SMSService
sms_service = SMSService()
notifier = Notifier(sms_service)
notifier.notify("Hello via SMS!")
```

- **Advantages**:
  - `Notifier` is now loosely coupled to the notification services.
  - Adding new services (e.g., `PushNotificationService`) requires no changes to `Notifier`.
  - The code is easier to test because we can inject mock services.

#### Dependency Injection Types
1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are passed via the constructor (as in the example above).
2. **Method Injection**: Dependencies are passed via a method.
3. **Property Injection**: Dependencies are set via attributes/properties.

### Example with Dependency Injection Framework: `inject` Library
Python supports dependency injection using libraries like `inject`.

```python
import inject


class EmailService:
    def send(self, message):
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")


class Notifier:
    @inject.params(service=EmailService)
    def __init__(self, service):
        self.service = service

    def notify(self, message):
        self.service.send(message)


# Configure dependencies
def configure_injections(binder):
    binder.bind(EmailService, EmailService())


inject.configure(configure_injections)

# Use the Notifier with injected dependency
notifier = Notifier()
notifier.notify("Hello with inject!")
```

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the three types of Dependency Injection (DI) with Python examples:

---

### 1. **Constructor Injection**
Dependencies are passed via the class constructor.

#### Example:
```python
class Service:
    def operation(self):
        print("Service operation executed.")

class Client:
    def __init__(self, service):
        self.service = service  # Dependency injected through constructor

    def do_task(self):
        self.service.operation()


service = Service()
client = Client(service)  # Inject dependency
client.do_task()  # Output: Service operation executed.
```

**Use Case**: Best for mandatory dependencies needed at object initialization.

---

### 2. **Method Injection**
Dependencies are passed as arguments to specific methods.

#### Example:
```python
class Service:
    def operation(self):
        print("Service operation executed.")

class Client:
    def do_task(self, service):  # Dependency injected through method
        service.operation()


service = Service()
client = Client()
client.do_task(service)  # Inject dependency when needed
# Output: Service operation executed.
```

**Use Case**: Useful when dependencies are only required for specific methods.

---

### 3. **Property Injection**
Dependencies are set via attributes or properties after the object is created.

#### Example:
```python
class Service:
    def operation(self):
        print("Service operation executed.")

class Client:
    def __init__(self):
        self.service = None  # Dependency initialized later

    def do_task(self):
        if self.service:
            self.service.operation()
        else:
            print("No service provided.")


service = Service()
client = Client()
client.service = service  # Inject dependency via property
client.do_task()  # Output: Service operation executed.
```

**Use Case**: Useful when dependencies are optional or need to be swapped at runtime.

---

### Summary
| Type                  | How Dependency is Injected             | Best Use Case                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Constructor**       | Via constructor (during initialization) | Mandatory dependencies                      |
| **Method**            | Via method arguments                   | Dependencies used in specific methods       |
| **Property**          | Via attributes/properties              | Optional or runtime-swappable dependencies  |



Yes, **Dependency Injection (DI)** typically represents a **HAS-A relationship** in object-oriented programming. Here's why:

### **Understanding HAS-A Relationship**
- A **HAS-A relationship** implies composition, where one object contains another object as a part of its structure.
- It indicates that one class relies on another class to perform certain operations or provide functionality.

### **Dependency Injection and HAS-A**
- In DI, a class (client) **has** dependencies (services), and these dependencies are provided (injected) externally rather than being created by the client itself.
- This is a clear example of composition: the client class uses the behavior of another class without inheriting from it.

---

### Example: HAS-A in Dependency Injection
```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started.")

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine  # HAS-A relationship through Dependency Injection

    def drive(self):
        self.engine.start()
        print("Car is driving.")


# Injecting the Engine dependency into the Car class
engine = Engine()
car = Car(engine)
car.drive()
```

**Explanation**:
- The `Car` class **has** an `Engine` (HAS-A relationship).
- The `Engine` object is provided to the `Car` externally (Dependency Injection).
- `Car` depends on `Engine`, but `Car` does not instantiate `Engine` itself, promoting loose coupling.

---

### Advantages of DI in HAS-A
1. **Loose Coupling**: The client class (`Car`) is decoupled from its dependencies (`Engine`), making it more modular and testable.
2. **Flexibility**: Dependencies can be swapped or mocked (e.g., for testing).
3. **Adherence to SOLID Principles**: Especially the **Dependency Inversion Principle** and the **Open/Closed Principle**.

---

### When Dependency Injection Doesn't Use HAS-A
If dependencies are purely functional and passed as arguments (e.g., a method that accepts a function or callable), the relationship is more behavioral and does not necessarily form a HAS-A relationship.
