The **Prototype Design Pattern** is a creational pattern that creates new objects by copying an existing object (prototype) rather than creating them from scratch. This is particularly useful when object creation is expensive or complex.

---

### **Simple Example: Cloning a Shape Object**

#### Without Prototype Pattern
You would have to create a new object and set all its properties manually.

```python
class Shape:
    def __init__(self, shape_type, color):
        self.shape_type = shape_type
        self.color = color

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Shape(type={self.shape_type}, color={self.color})"


# Creating shapes manually
shape1 = Shape("Circle", "Red")
shape2 = Shape("Circle", "Blue")  # Redundant initialization
print(shape1)
print(shape2)
```

---

#### With Prototype Pattern
You can clone an existing object to create a new one with the same or modified attributes.

```python
import copy

class Shape:
    def __init__(self, shape_type, color):
        self.shape_type = shape_type
        self.color = color

    def clone(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)  # Create a deep copy of the object

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Shape(type={self.shape_type}, color={self.color})"


# Create an original object
original_shape = Shape("Circle", "Red")
print("Original:", original_shape)

# Clone the object and modify the clone
cloned_shape = original_shape.clone()
cloned_shape.color = "Blue"
print("Cloned:", cloned_shape)

# Output:
# Original: Shape(type=Circle, color=Red)
# Cloned: Shape(type=Circle, color=Blue)
```

### **Explanation**
1. **Prototype**: The `clone()` method allows duplicating an object.
2. **Deep Copy**: Ensures a completely independent copy, avoiding shared references.

---

### **Advantages**
1. **Efficient Object Creation**: Avoids re-initializing and configuring an object from scratch.
2. **Simplifies Complex Object Structures**: Especially useful for objects with multiple nested properties.

### **When to Use?**
- When object creation is resource-intensive or requires a complex configuration.
- When you need multiple objects with similar properties.
