# Designing a Chess Game

In this blog post, we explore the object-oriented design and implementation of a Chess game using Java. 

Chess offers an excellent platform to apply object-oriented programming principles due to its complex rules and variety of pieces.

## System Requirements

The Chess game should:

1. **Handle Game Setup:** Set up the chessboard with pieces in their initial positions.
2. **Manage Player Turns:** Alternate turns between two players, white and black.
3. **Enforce Chess Rules:** Validate moves based on chess rules.
4. **Check Game Status:** Identify check, checkmate, and stalemate conditions.

## Core Use Cases

1. **Moving a Piece:** Players move pieces on the board.
2. **Capturing Pieces:** Implement logic for capturing opponent's pieces.
3. **Checking Game Status:** Detect check, checkmate, or stalemate.
4. **Ending the Game:** Conclude the game based on the outcome.

## UML/Class Diagrams

Key Classes:

- `ChessGame`: Manages overall gameplay.
- `Board`: Represents the chessboard.
- `Piece`: Abstract class for different types of chess pieces.
- `Player`: Represents a player.
- `Move`: Represents a move.

## Java Implementation

### Piece Class
Abstract class for chess pieces.
```java
public abstract class Piece {
    protected boolean isWhite;

    public Piece(boolean isWhite) {
        this.isWhite = isWhite;
    }

    public abstract boolean canMove(Board board, Box start, Box end);
}
```
### Board Class
Represents the chessboard.
```java
public class Board {
    private Box[][] boxes;

    public Board() {
        this.resetBoard();
    }

    public Box getBox(int x, int y) {
        return boxes[x][y];
    }

    private void resetBoard() {
        // Initialize boxes with pieces
    }
}
```
### Player Class
Represents a player in the game.
```java
public class Player {
    public boolean whiteSide;
    public boolean humanPlayer;

    public Player(boolean whiteSide, boolean humanPlayer) {
        this.whiteSide = whiteSide;
        this.humanPlayer = humanPlayer;
    }
}
```
### Move Class
Represents a move in the game.
```java
public class Move {
    private Player player;
    private Box start;
    private Box end;
    private Piece pieceMoved;

    public Move(Player player, Box start, Box end) {
        this.player = player;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
        this.pieceMoved = start.getPiece();
    }

    // Getters and setters...
}
```
### ChessGame Class
Manages the overall game.
```java
public class ChessGame {
    private Player[] players;
    private Board board;
    private Player currentTurn;
    private List<Move> movesPlayed;

    public ChessGame() {
        players = new Player[2];
        board = new Board();
        movesPlayed = new ArrayList<>();
        currentTurn = players[0]; // White starts the game
    }

    public boolean playerMove(Player player, int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY) {
        Box startBox = board.getBox(startX, startY);
        Box endBox = board.getBox(endX, endY);
        Move move = new Move(player, startBox, endBox);
        return makeMove(move, player);
    }

    private boolean makeMove(Move move, Player player) {
        // Implement move logic, including validation and piece capture
        return true; // Assuming move is valid
    }

    // Other necessary methods...
}
```
