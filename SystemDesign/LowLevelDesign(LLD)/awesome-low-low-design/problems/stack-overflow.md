# Designing Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is a widely-used question-and-answer platform for programmers, known for its community-driven approach to solving coding problems. 

In this blog post, we'll delve into the object-oriented design of a simplified version of Stack Overflow, covering everything from requirements to a complete Java implementation.

## Requirements
- User Management: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- Question Handling: Users can post, view, and search for questions.
- Answering Questions: Users can answer posted questions.
- Comment System: Users can comment on both questions and answers.
- Voting System: Users can upvote or downvote questions and answers.

## Core Use Cases
- Posting Questions
- Answering Questions
- Commenting on Questions and Answers
- Voting on Questions and Answers

## Classes
- **User Class:** Manages user details, their posted questions, and answers.
- **Question Class:** Represents a question, including its answers, comments, and votes.
- **Answer Class:** Represents an answer to a question, with comments and votes.
- **Comment Class:** Represents a comment made on either a question or an answer.
- **Vote Class:** Manages voting on questions and answers.
- **QuestionBoard Class:** Manages the collection of questions posted to the platform.

## Java Implementation
### User Class
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class User {
    private String username;
    private String password; // For simplicity, not encrypted here

    public User(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    // Post a question
    public Question postQuestion(String title, String content) {
        return new Question(title, content, this);
    }

    // Post an answer
    public Answer postAnswer(Question question, String answerText) {
        Answer answer = new Answer(this, answerText);
        question.addAnswer(answer);
        return answer;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```

### Question Class
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Question {
    private String title;
    private String content;
    private User askedBy;
    private ArrayList<Answer> answers;
    private ArrayList<Comment> comments;
    private ArrayList<Vote> votes;

    public Question(String title, String content, User askedBy) {
        this.title = title;
        this.content = content;
        this.askedBy = askedBy;
        this.answers = new ArrayList<>();
        this.comments = new ArrayList<>();
        this.votes = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    // Add an answer to this question
    public void addAnswer(Answer answer) {
        answers.add(answer);
    }

    // Add a comment to this question
    public void addComment(Comment comment) {
        comments.add(comment);
    }

    // Add a vote to this question
    public void addVote(Vote vote) {
        votes.add(vote);
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```

### Answer Class
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Answer {
    private User responder;
    private String answerText;
    private ArrayList<Comment> comments;
    private ArrayList<Vote> votes;

    public Answer(User responder, String answerText) {
        this.responder = responder;
        this.answerText = answerText;
        this.comments = new ArrayList<>();
        this.votes = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    // Add a comment to this answer
    public void addComment(Comment comment) {
        comments.add(comment);
    }

    // Add a vote to this answer
    public void addVote(Vote vote) {
        votes.add(vote);
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```

### Comment Class
```java
public class Comment {
    private User commenter;
    private String text;

    public Comment(User commenter, String text) {
        this.commenter = commenter;
        this.text = text;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```

### Vote Class
```java
public class Vote {
    private User voter;
    private boolean isUpvote;

    public Vote(User voter, boolean isUpvote) {
        this.voter = voter;
        this.isUpvote = isUpvote;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```
